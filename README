Intro:

A collection of tools for geographic calculations and geocoding for use in CodeIgniter based applications.

Currently the only functions offered are those to calculate the distance between points, specified by a Latitude, Longitude pair.

Installation:

You can either use http://getsparks.org to install via the spark installer.  Visit http://getsparks.org/packages/geotools/versions/HEAD/show to install it.

or

1) Extract the archive you get from here.
2) Put libraries/geotools.php and libraries/geopoint.php into your applications libraries directory.


Usage:

If you've installed via the spark then add the following to your controller.

$this->load->spark('geotools');

or 

$this->load->library('geotools');

if you've installed manually.


To calculate the distance between two points create the two locations by callign the geopoint function.

$startPoint = $this->geotools->geopoint(55.8333, -4.25);
$endPoint = $this->geotools->geopoint(55.9464, -3.1991);

Then call the distanceBetween function to calculate the distance between the two locations.

$this->geotools->distanceBetween($startPoint, $endPoint, $algorithm, $unit);

Two algorithms are available to calculate distance.

Pythagorean theory -  faster but less accurate over longer distances.
Haversine - fairly accurate but has a larger performance hit.  This is the default option.

Units supported are 'miles' and 'km'.  Miles are returned by default.


Problems? Suggestions?
